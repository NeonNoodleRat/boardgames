                        <strong>Description:</strong> <br />
                        5-Minute Dungeon is a chaotic, co-operative, real-time card game in which players have only five minutes
                        to escape the randomized dungeon. Communication and teamwork are critical to survival because there's no
                        time to form a carefully considered plan &amp;mdash; and no predicting what dangers lie
                        ahead.<br /><br />In more detail, players assume the role of one of ten heroes, each with special cards
                        and abilities. Once the five-minute timer starts, the race is on to defeat all the monsters inside the
                        dungeon. In order to defeat a monster, players must match symbols from their hand with ones on the
                        monster's card. At the end of each dungeon is a powerful dungeon boss &amp;mdash; and after the first
                        boss is defeated, the campaign continues to the second boss. Each boss, and each randomized dungeon,
                        gets harder until players reach the fifth and final boss.<br /><br />

                        You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World. Gather resources, develop
                        commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder
                        which will transcend future times.<br /><br />7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive
                        seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent
                        player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or
                        interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on
                        which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card
                        from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that
                        age. After three ages, the game ends.<br /><br />In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some
                        cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards
                        provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and
                        others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll
                        know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how his choices might affect what you've already built
                        up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in
                        both directions.<br /><br />Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3&amp;ndash;7
                        players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.<br /><br />

                        <strong>Description:</strong> <br />
                        Anomia plays off the fact that our minds are positively brimming with all sorts of random information:
                        things to eat, pop songs, websites, etc... Sure, under normal circumstances, it's easy to give an
                        example of a frozen food or a dog breed, but you'll find that your brain works a little differently
                        under pressure!<br /><br />To play, draw and reveal a card from the center pile. Does the symbol on your
                        card match one on another player's card? If so, you must quickly face-off with the other player by
                        giving an example of the person, place, or thing on their card before they can do the same for yours. If
                        you blurt out a correct answer first, you win their card and the drawing continues.<br /><br />Sounds
                        simple, right? Wrong! Wild cards allow non-matching symbols to match, increasing the number of things to
                        which you must pay attention. Cascading face-offs can occur when you hand over a lost card, thereby
                        revealing a new top card on your play pile.<br /><br />

                        Introduced by the Moors, azulejos (originally white and blue ceramic tiles) were fully embraced by the
                        Portuguese when their king Manuel I, on a visit to the Alhambra palace in Southern Spain, was mesmerized
                        by the stunning beauty of the Moorish decorative tiles. The king, awestruck by the interior beauty of
                        the Alhambra, immediately ordered that his own palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles.
                        As a tile-laying artist, you have been challenged to embellish the walls of the Royal Palace of
                        Evora.<br /><br />In the game Azul, players take turns drafting colored tiles from suppliers to their
                        player board. Later in the round, players score points based on how they've placed their tiles to
                        decorate the palace. Extra points are scored for specific patterns and completing sets; wasted supplies
                        harm the player's score. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.<br /><br />

                        Bananagrams is a fast and fun word game that requires no pencil, paper or board, and the tiles come in a
                        fabric banana-shaped carrying pouch. One hand can be played in as little as five minutes. Much like Pick
                        Two!, but without the letter values.<br /><br />Using a selection of 144 plastic letter tiles in the
                        English edition, each player works independently to create their own 'crossword' faster than one's
                        opponents. When a player uses up all their letters, all players take a new tile from the pool. The
                        object of the game is to be the first to complete a word grid after the &amp;quot;bunch&amp;quot; of
                        tiles has been depleted.<br /><br />There are variants included in the instructions, such as Banana
                        Smoothie and Banana cafe for limited set skills or space-deprived places, and the game is suitable for
                        solo play.<br /><br />

                        In the U.S. wild west, the eternal battle between the law and the outlaws keeps heating up. Suddenly, a
                        rain of arrows darken the sky: It's an Indian attack! Are you bold enough to keep up with the Indians?
                        Do you have the courage to challenge your fate? Can you expose and defeat the ruthless gunmen around
                        you?<br /><br />BANG! The Dice Game keeps the core of the Bang! card game in place. At the start of the
                        game, players each take a role card that secretly places them on a team: the Sheriff and deputies,
                        outlaws, and renegades. The Sheriff and deputies need to kill the outlaws, the outlaws win by killing
                        the Sheriff, and the renegades want to be the last players alive in the game.<br /><br />Each player
                        also receives a character card which grants him a special power in the game. The Sheriff reveals his
                        role card and takes the first turn of the game. On a turn, a player can roll the five dice up to three
                        times, using the results of the dice to shoot neighboring players, increase the range of his shots, heal
                        his (or anyone else's) life points, or put him in range of the Indians, which are represented by nine
                        tokens in the center of the table. Each time a player rolls an arrow, he takes one of these tokens; when
                        the final token is taken, each player loses one life point for each token he holds, then the tokens are
                        returned to the center of the table.<br /><br />If a player collects a trio of Gatling symbols on the
                        dice, he fires one shot at everyone else and rids himself of Indian tokens. Who'll get his shot off
                        first? Play continues until one team meets its winning condition &amp;ndash; and death won't necessarily
                        keep you from winning as long as your teammates pull through!<br /><br />

                        parts) and baby cards. When you draw a part, you use it to build a monster for yourself; when you draw a
                        baby, it goes in the center of the table. When babies are provoked, they attack, and anyone who has
                        fewer monster parts than the number of attacking babies loses their monster; everyone with more parts
                        than babies defeats this infantile army and scores.<br /><br />

                        through the vines. Jack, with one arm around his precious stolen harp and the other grasping the
                        beanstalk, felt the rush of danger. Will he make it to the bottom in time to chop down the leafy ladder,
                        or will the giant successfully catch the thieving beggar?<br /><br />In The Blood of an Englishman,
                        players take on the role of either Jack or the Giant. The Giant must maneuver the Fee Fi Fo and Fum
                        cards while Jack tries to create three beanstalks to steal the bag of gold, the Golden Goose, and the
                        Singing Harp. Each player has different available actions and must carefully arrange the cards to
                        achieve their goal. Are you brave enough to face your fate?<br /><br />

                        Boggle is a timed word game in which players have 3 minutes to find as many connected words as possible
                        from the face up letters resting in a 16 cube grid. When the timer runs out, players compare their lists
                        of words and remove any words found by multiple players. Points are then awarded for remaining words,
                        depending on how many letters are in the word. (In the original Boggle, all words must contain 3 or more
                        letters to score points.)<br /><br />An example grid given in the French Canadian rules (of Deluxe
                        Boggle) holds an amazing 459 words!<br /><br />A number of variants have been produced by Parker
                        Brothers over time, including Big Boggle (which uses a 5&amp;times;5 grid of letters and forces players
                        to search for longer words).<br /><br />Boggle is a word dice game.<br /><br />

                        Welcome to the most popular bubble tea shop in Taiwan where you'll find drinks flavored like rich milk
                        tea with a chewy texture and unforgettable good taste!<br /><br />To make an unforgettable bubble tea,
                        you need to pay attention to crucial elements like having more bubbles and less sugar; even your method
                        for adding ice will make the drink taste differently. Sounds good, right? If you can't wait to make your
                        own, let us shake it!<br /><br />In Bubble Tea, each player has two cards called cups and nine bubble
                        tea ingredient cards. One player uses the shaker to shake out which ingredients will be needed this
                        game, and whoever assembles these ingredients the quickest wins the game and gets the
                        rewards!<br /><br />Bubble Tea is a table game which improves your quickness and reaction time. In
                        Bubble Tea, players have to roll 6 dice by the real shaker and using 9 plastic cards to match pictures
                        which shown on dice. The player who finds the correct combination first gets a Customer Card. Whoever
                        gets 3 Customer Cards in the end wins the game and becomes the master of BUBBLE TEA!<br /><br />

                        Like all the other games of the &amp;quot;Settlers of Catan&amp;quot; series, this game is about
                        building settlements, roads, cities and hiring knights. This time, there is no board on which to place
                        little figures: Every player has his own score card called the building sheet, which depicts a mini
                        Catan (compare with Die Siedler von Catan: Paper &amp; Pencil). You build by drawing the settlements and
                        roads on your score card.<br /><br />To build you still require resources. These are collected by a
                        Yahtzee-like mechanism that involves throwing six special dice (depicting the different resource
                        symbols) up to three times. After each roll, the player can select which dice to keep and which to roll
                        again. In the end, he may build using the thusly determined resources, and is awarded victory points for
                        any finished buildings, which are recorded on the score card.<br /><br />The game lasts fifteen turns or
                        about 15-30 minutes, after which the player with the most victory points wins.<br /><br />Note that the
                        game has been designed for 1-4 players, meaning there is a solitaire version of the game, as
                        well.<br /><br />Recent versions include double-sided map sheets and instructions for Les Colons de
                        Catane: Le jeu de dés.<br /><br />

                        Compounded is a game about building chemical compounds through careful management of elements, a fair
                        bit of social play and trading, and just a bit of luck. In Compounded, players take on the roles of lab
                        managers, hastily competing to complete the most compounds before they are completed by others
                        &amp;ndash; or destroyed in an explosion. Some compounds are flammable and will grow more and more
                        volatile over time; take too long to gather the necessary elements for those compounds and a lot of hard
                        work will soon be scattered across the lab.<br /><br />Although Compounded does involve a fair share of
                        press-your-luck tension and certainly some strategic planning, the most successful scientists will often
                        be those who strike a good trade with their fellow lab mates. Players are able to freely trade elements,
                        laboratory tools, and even favors &amp;ndash; if there is truly honor among chemists!<br /><br />

                        images on the 6 cards in her hand. From one of these, she makes up a sentence and says it out loud
                        (without showing the card to the other players).<br /><br />Each other player selects the card in their
                        hands which best matches the sentence and gives the selected card to the storyteller, without showing it
                        to the others.<br /><br />The storyteller shuffles her card with all the received cards. All pictures
                        are shown face up and every player has to bet upon which picture was the storyteller's.<br /><br />If
                        nobody or everybody finds the correct card, the storyteller scores 0, and each of the other players
                        scores 2. Otherwise the storyteller and whoever found the correct answer score 3. Players score 1 point
                        for every vote for their own card.<br /><br />The game ends when the deck is empty or if a player scores
                        30 points. In either case, the player with the most points wins the game.<br /><br />The base game and

                        horrible creatures. Will your party be able to defeat the final boss?<br /><br />In Dungeon Fighter, a
                        fully cooperative board game, players take on the roles of heroes venturing deep into a three-tier
                        dungeon. Along the way, they explore the dungeon, search its many rooms, and face endless hordes of
                        vicious monsters. Best of all, your skill determines the ability of your character. Can you kill Medusa
                        without looking into her eyes, defeat the Minotaur in the labyrinth, or resist the breath of the dragon?
                        Will you be able to hit a target by throwing the dice under your leg with your eyes
                        closed?<br /><br />You will feel truly part of a centuries-old battle between good and evil...with a
                        touch of foolish stupidity.<br /><br />

                        flinging, dual daggers slinging, and spiked shields dinging, it's up to you to prove your adventurer has
                        the guts to bring home the glory!<br /><br />Illustrations created by Kyle Ferrin in the four decks of

                        In many ways Dungeon! is similar to Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, although much simplified and transformed
                        into a board game. Players explore a dungeon that is divided into levels of increasing difficulty,
                        fighting monsters for valuable treasure. As players venture deeper into the dungeon, the monsters become
                        more difficult and the treasure more valuable. Several character classes each have slightly different
                        fighting abilities &amp;ndash; most notably the wizard, who can cast spells. Combat is simulated using
                        dice; players roll the dice to attack a monster, and if unsuccessful, the dice are rolled to determine
                        the effect of the monster's counter-attack.<br /><br />The winner is the first player to bring a certain
                        amount of treasure back to the Dungeon's entrance.<br /><br />Reimplemented by:<br /><br /><br /> The
                        Classic Dungeon<br /> The New Dungeon<br /><br /><br />

                        In Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons: Rock Paper Wizard, the dragon has been slain, leaving behind a treasure
                        over which to fight, and the players are wizards who are fighting to claim the most gold from the
                        dragon's pile.<br /><br />The players have a shared &amp;quot;spellbook&amp;quot; of cards depicting
                        various well-known D&amp;amp;D spells, and each card shows a unique hand gesture that the player must
                        make to cast, while pointing at another player as the target of the spell. All players choose their
                        spells simultaneously, and the spells can move the wizards closer or farther away from the treasure or
                        affect the game state in other ways as well. It's a game of second-guessing, satisfying successes, and
                        agonizing reversals as each spell cast potentially affects the outcomes of the following
                        ones!<br /><br />The first player to grab 25 gold pieces from the hoard wins.<br /><br />

                        Wizard, a new threat has entered the mix: the wandering monster. Each wandering monster has its own
                        unique ability that's capable of forcing a wizard to move around the board, lose gold, or even take an
                        injury token.<br /><br />Wizards aren't totally defenseless, however. A stack of magical items, such as

                        combination with spells to avoid the wandering monster and move into a scoring position while gaining
                        the fewest injury tokens. If you don't, you're going to have the pay the cleric a sack of gold to heal

                        Between the cracks, shadowrunners carve out a living as deniable and disposable assets that megacorps
                        fire at each other for datasteals, personnel extractions, or even wetwork. Whether casting manabolts of
                        magic, riding the electrons of the Matrix with just the brain, or slinging good, old-fashioned flying
                        lead while firing at speed enhanced by the latest in bio-engineering, runners live dangerously and hope

                        player fast-paced, pushed-your-luck dice and card game. Players take the role of Mr. Johnson, arranging

                        the boss.<br /><br />The goal of the game is to be the first player to acquire &amp;yen;30. <br />Each
                        player starts the game with (1) runner and 6 dice. At the start of your turn you flip over location
                        card, that has effects aka breaks the rules, on every turn until a new environment card comes into play.
                        You then flip over the top Event card form the deck and try and roll an exact match of the number on the
                        card. If you succeed you place a die on the. You could stop then and receive &amp;yen;1 or flip a card
                        and continue to press your luck. If you fail the next player starts a new run with a chance to collect n

                        Exploding Kittens is a kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette. Players take turns drawing cards until
                        someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid
                        exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or
                        shuffling the deck.<br /><br />The game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer
                        cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of
                        feline hyperbole.<br /><br />

                        Fluxx is a card game in which the cards themselves determine the current rules of the game. By playing
                        cards, you change numerous aspects of the game: how to draw cards, how to play cards, and even how to
                        win.<br /><br />At the start of the game, each player holds three cards and on a turn a player draws one
                        card, then plays one card. By playing cards, you can put new rules into play that change numerous
                        aspects of the game: how many cards to draw or play, how many cards you can hold in hand or keep on the
                        table in front of you, and (most importantly) how to win the game. There are many editions, themed
                        siblings, and promo cards available.<br /><br />

                        <strong>Description:</strong> <br />
                        Forbidden Island is a visually stunning cooperative board game. Instead of winning by competing with
                        other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving
                        their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles
                        before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and
                        the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect
                        treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be
                        made.<br /><br />What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the
                        extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and
                        organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted
                        and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The
                        island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and
                        pleasing image.<br /><br />With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each
                        with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available,
                        Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four
                        (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though
                        the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age.
                        Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable
                        price.<br /> For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden
                        Desert was released in 2013.<br /><br />From the publisher's website:<br /><br />Dare to discover
                        Forbidden Island! Join a team of fearless adventurers on a do-or-die mission to capture four sacred
                        treasures from the ruins of this perilous paradise. Your team will have to work together and make some
                        pulse-pounding maneuvers, as the island will sink beneath every step! Race to collect the treasures and
                        make a triumphant escape before you are swallowed into the watery abyss!<br /><br />

                        The Grizzled is a cooperative game about survival in the trenches during the first World War where
                        players win or lose together.<br /><br />Each round, the current team leader will choose how many cards
                        every player draws. Then, going around the table, players must either play a card in their hand or back
                        out of the mission. Each card represents either threats to the team (such as mortar shells and weather
                        conditions) or negative personality traits (such as frightened or obsessive). At the end of the round,
                        more cards are added to the draw deck. The game ends only if the players can deplete the draw deck as
                        well as their hands without letting time run out.<br /><br />If one threat shows up too many times, the
                        team fails the mission. The team must play their threats correctly in order to gain any progress.
                        However, most of the information in a players hand remains secret throughout the
                        game.<br /><br />Planning, teamwork, and a little luck are the tools you'll need to win this cooperative
                        game for two to five players.<br /><br />

                        Hanabi&amp;mdash;named for the Japanese word for &amp;quot;fireworks&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;is a
                        cooperative game in which players try to create the perfect fireworks show by placing the cards on the
                        table in the right order. (In Japanese, hanabi is written as 花火; these are the ideograms flower and
                        fire, respectively.)<br /><br />The card deck consists of five different colors of cards, numbered
                        1&amp;ndash;5 in each color. For each color, the players try to place a row in the correct order from
                        1&amp;ndash;5. Sounds easy, right? Well, not quite, as in this game you hold your cards so that they're
                        visible only to other players. To assist other players in playing a card, you must give them hints
                        regarding the numbers or the colors of their cards. Players must act as a team to avoid errors and to
                        finish the fireworks display before they run out of cards.<br /><br />An extra suit of cards, rainbow
                        colored, is also provided for advanced or variant play.<br /><br />Hanabi was originally published as
                        part of Hanabi &amp; Ikebana.<br /><br />

                        Hanafuda cards originated in beginning of 18th-century Japan. <br />Legend says stewards of Edo
                        Shogunate created it from Portuguese playing cards.<br /><br />A deck consists of forty-eight cards
                        divided into twelve suits of four cards each. Each suit represents one of the twelve months of the year
                        or individual plants (almost all flowers).<br /><br />The cards are small (about 1 x 2 inches), made
                        from stiff cardboard, and are beautifully illustrated.<br /><br />Many different games can be played
                        with a Hanafuda deck.<br /><br />The standard game was Hachi-Hachi (Eighty-eight), which resembles the
                        Western game Casino, but is more complicated and subtle. The standard game now is
                        Koi-Koi.<br /><br />Re-implemented by:<br /><br /> Go Stop, the game using Hwatu (화투, 花闘), Korean

                        Hive is a highly addictive strategic game for two players that is not restricted by a board and can be
                        played anywhere on any flat surface. The base game of Hive is made up of twenty two pieces, eleven black
                        and eleven white, resembling a variety of creatures each with a unique way of moving. Hive Carbon and
                        Hive Pocket include the Mosquito and Ladybug expansions, for a total of 26 pieces.<br /><br />With no
                        setting up to do, the game begins when the first piece is placed down. As the subsequent pieces are
                        placed this forms a pattern that becomes the playing surface (the pieces themselves become the board).
                        Unlike other such games, the pieces are never eliminated and not all have to be played. The object of
                        the game is to totally surround your opponent's queen, while at the same time trying to block your
                        opponent from doing likewise to your queen. The first player to totally surround his opponent's queen
                        wins the game.<br /><br />

                        Played with 10 &amp;quot;jacks&amp;quot; and a small rubber ball. Players take turns. On a player's
                        turn, he must first throw the jacks onto the floor. If any of the jacks land so that they are stacked on
                        top of each other, he forfeits his turn. Otherwise, he begins to pick the jacks up in groups. He throws
                        the ball up in the air, and must pick up a group and catch the ball after exactly one bounce. A player
                        must first succeed in picking up all 10 jacks one at a time in a single turn. Then he attempts to pick
                        up the jacks two at a time, then in groups of three, and continuing on until he must pick up all 10
                        jacks in one group. If at any time, the player picks up the wrong number of jacks, touches any jacks not
                        in the group, or fails to catch the ball, his turn is over. On his next turn, he will try again,
                        starting with the same grouping.<br /><br />

                        You are one of the two most powerful traders in the city of Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, but that's
                        not enough for you because only the merchant with two &amp;quot;seals of excellence&amp;quot; will have
                        the privilege of being invited to the Maharaja's court. You are therefore going to have to do better
                        than your direct competitor by buying, exchanging, and selling at better prices, all while keeping an
                        eye on both your camel herds.<br /><br />Jaipur is a fast-paced card game, a blend of tactics, risk and
                        luck. On your turn, you can either take or sell cards. If you take cards, you have to choose between
                        taking all the camels, taking one card from the market, or swapping 2-5 cards between the market and
                        your cards.<br /><br />If you sell cards, you get to sell only one type of good, and you receive as many
                        chips for that good as the number of cards you sold. The chips' values decrease as the game progresses,
                        so you'd better hurry! On the other hand, you receive increasingly high rewards for selling three, four,
                        or five cards of the same good at a time, so you'd better wait!<br /><br />You can't sell camels, but
                        they're paramount for trading and they're also worth a little something at the end of the round, enough
                        sometimes to secure the win, so you have to use them smartly.<br /><br />

                        In JAWS, one player takes on the role of the killer shark off Amity Island, while the other 1-3 players
                        take on the roles of Brody, Hooper and Quint to hunt the shark. Character and event cards define player
                        abilities and create game actions for humans and the shark. Gameplay is divided into two acts
                        &amp;mdash; Amity Island and The Orca &amp;mdash; played on a double-sided board to replicate the film's
                        story:<br /><br /><br /> In the Amity Island phase, the shark menaces swimmers and avoids capture. Other
                        players attempt to pinpoint the shark's location and save swimmers from shark attacks.<br /> In the Orca
                        phase, played on the reverse side of the game board, Brody, Hooper and Quint are aboard the sinking ship
                        engaging in a climactic battle against the shark, while using additional action and strategy cards to
                        defend the Orca from targeted shark attacks.<br /><br /><br />If humans kill the shark, they win; if the
                        shark attack on the Orca succeeds, the great white shark wins.<br /><br />

                        Mancala is a whole family of games.<br /><br />This entry is referencing only the popular game also
                        known as Kalah, invented in the 1940 by William Champion Jr..<br /><br />The game is played on a board
                        of two rows, each consisting of six round pits. The rows have a large store at either end called kalah.
                        <br />A player owns the six pits closest to him and the kalah on his right side. <br />Beginners may
                        start with 3 seeds in each pit, but the game becomes more and more challenging by starting with 4, 5 or
                        up to 6 seeds in each pit. Today, 4 seeds per pit has become the most common variant, but Champion
                        recommended the expert game with 6.<br /><br />A player takes all the seeds from one of his pits, they
                        are distributed one by one, counterclockwise, in the pits and the players own kalah, but not into the
                        opponent's store.<br /><br />If the last seed is dropped into an opponent's pit or a non-empty pit of
                        the player, the move ends without anything being captured.<br />If the last seed falls into the player's
                        kalah, he must move again.<br />If the last seed is put into an empty pit owned by the player, he
                        captures all contents of the opposite pit together with the capturing piece and puts them in his kalah.
                        If the opposite pit is empty, nothing is captured. A capture ends the move.<br /><br />The game ends
                        when one player no longer has any seeds in any of his holes. The remaining pieces are captured by his
                        adversary. The player who has captured most pieces is declared the winner.<br /><br />

                        <strong>Description:</strong> <br />
                        In King of Tokyo, you play mutant monsters, gigantic robots, and strange aliens&amp;mdash;all of whom
                        are destroying Tokyo and whacking each other in order to become the one and only King of
                        Tokyo.<br /><br />At the start of each turn, you roll six dice, which show the following six symbols: 1,
                        2, or 3 Victory Points, Energy, Heal, and Attack. Over three successive throws, choose whether to keep
                        or discard each die in order to win victory points, gain energy, restore health, or attack other players
                        into understanding that Tokyo is YOUR territory.<br /><br />The fiercest player will occupy Tokyo, and
                        earn extra victory points, but that player can't heal and must face all the other monsters
                        alone!<br /><br />Top this off with special cards purchased with energy that have a permanent or
                        temporary effect, such as the growing of a second head which grants you an additional die, body armor,
                        nova death ray, and more.... and it's one of the most explosive games of the year!<br /><br />In order
                        to win the game, one must either destroy Tokyo by accumulating 20 victory points, or be the only
                        surviving monster once the fighting has ended.<br /><br />First Game in the King of Tokyo

                        In Kingdomino, you are a lord seeking new lands in which to expand your kingdom. You must explore all
                        the lands, including wheat fields, lakes, and mountains, in order to spot the best plots, while
                        competing with other lords to acquire them first.<br /><br />The game uses tiles with two sections,
                        similar to Dominoes. Each turn, each player will select a new domino to connect to their existing
                        kingdom, making sure at least one of its sides connects to a matching terrain type already in play. The
                        order of who picks first depends on which tile was previously chosen, with better tiles forcing players
                        to pick later in the next round. The game ends when each player has completed a 5x5 grid (or failed to
                        do so), and points are counted based on number of connecting tiles and valuable crown
                        symbols.<br /><br />

                        All of the eligible young men (and many of the not-so-young) seek to woo the princess of Tempest.
                        Unfortunately, she has locked herself in the palace, and you must rely on others to take your romantic
                        letters to her. Will yours reach her first?<br /><br />Love Letter is a game of risk, deduction, and
                        luck for 2&amp;ndash;4 players. Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while
                        deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts
                        with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one
                        card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make
                        you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the
                        fire!<br /><br />Number 4 in the Tempest: Shared World Game Series<br /><br />

                        Welcome to the city of Machi Koro. You've just been elected Mayor. Congrats! Unfortunately the citizens
                        have some pretty big demands: jobs, a theme park, a couple of cheese factories and maybe even a radio
                        tower. A tough proposition since the city currently consists of a wheat field, a bakery and a single
                        die.<br /><br />Armed only with your trusty die and a dream, you must grow Machi Koro into the largest
                        city in the region. You will need to collect income from developments, build public works, and steal
                        from your neighbors' coffers. Just make sure they aren't doing the same to you!<br /><br />Machi Koro is
                        a fast-paced game for 2-4 players. Each player wants to develop the city on their own terms in order to
                        complete all of the landmarks under construction faster than their rivals. On their turn, each player
                        rolls one or two dice. If the sum of the dice rolled matches the number of a building that a player
                        owns, they get the effect of that building; in some cases opponents will also benefit from your dice
                        (just as you can benefit from theirs). Then, with money in hand a player can build a landmark or a new
                        building, ideally adding to the wealth of their city on future turns. The first player to construct all
                        of their landmarks wins!<br /><br />

                        Description from the publisher:<br /><br />After being stripped of all their possessions, a mage, a
                        warrior, an elf, and a dwarf are forced to go rob the local Magic Maze shopping mall for all the
                        equipment necessary for their next adventure. They agree to map out the labyrinth in its entirety first,
                        then find each individual&amp;rsquo;s favorite store, and then locate the exit. In order to evade the
                        surveillance of the guards who eyed their arrival suspiciously, all four will pull off their heists
                        simultaneously, then dash to the exit. That's the plan anyway&amp;hellip;but can they pull it
                        off?<br /><br />Magic Maze is a real-time, cooperative game. Each player can control any hero in order
                        to make that hero perform a very specific action, to which the other players do not have access: Move
                        north, explore a new area, ride an escalator&amp;hellip; All this requires rigorous cooperation between
                        the players in order to succeed at moving the heroes prudently. However, you are allowed to communicate
                        only for short periods during the game; the rest of the time, you must play without giving any visual or
                        audio cues to each other. If all of the heroes succeed in leaving the shopping mall in the limited time
                        allotted for the game, each having stolen a very specific item, then everyone wins
                        together.<br /><br />At the start of the game, you have only three minutes in which to take actions.
                        Hourglass spaces you encounter along the way give you more time. If the sand timer ever completely runs
                        out, all players lose the game: Your loitering has aroused suspicion, and the mall security guards nab
                        you!<br /><br />

                        The Mind is more than just a game. It's an experiment, a journey, a team experience in which you can't
                        exchange information, yet will become one to defeat all the levels of the game.<br /><br />In more
                        detail, the deck contains cards numbered 1-100, and during the game you try to complete 12, 10, or 8
                        levels of play with 2, 3, or 4 players. In a level, each player receives a hand of cards equal to the
                        number of the level: one card in level 1, two cards in level 2, etc. Collectively you must play these
                        cards into the center of the table on a single discard pile in ascending order but you cannot
                        communicate with one another in any way as to which cards you hold. You simply stare into one another's
                        eyes, and when you feel the time is right, you play your lowest card. If no one holds a card lower than
                        what you played, great, the game continues! If someone did, all players discard face up all cards lower
                        than what you played, and you lose one life.<br /><br />You start the game with a number of lives equal
                        to the number of players. Lose all your lives, and you lose the game. You start with one shuriken as
                        well, and if everyone wants to use a shuriken, each player discards their lowest card face up, giving
                        everyone information and getting you closer to completing the level. As you complete levels, you might
                        receive a reward of a shuriken or an extra life. Complete all the levels, and you win!<br /><br />For an
                        extra challenge, play The Mind in extreme mode with all played cards going onto the stack face down. You
                        don't look at the cards played until the end of a level, losing lives at that time for cards played out
                        of order.<br /><br />

                        One Deck Dungeon is a card game &amp;quot;roguelike&amp;quot; &amp;mdash; a dungeon delve that is
                        different every time, difficult to survive, with a character you build up from scratch. The deck
                        consists of various foes to combat and other perils from the dungeon. Each card, though, depicts both
                        the obstacle to overcome and the potential rewards for doing so. When you defeat a card, you claim it as
                        either experience, an item, or a skill, tucking it under the appropriate side of your character card to
                        show its benefits.<br /><br />The longer you take exploring the dungeon, the deeper you'll delve, and
                        the difficulty will scale up quickly! If you make it far enough, you'll have to fight the dungeon boss.
                        Survive, and you'll be a legend!<br /><br />One Deck Dungeon is designed for 1-2 players. With multiple
                        sets, you can add more players.<br /><br />

                        You are a Dreamwalker, lost in a mysterious labyrinth, and you must discover the oneiric doors before
                        your dreamtime runs out &amp;ndash; or you will remain trapped forever!<br /><br />You may wander
                        through the chambers of dreams, hoping that chance will reveal the doors, or you can linger in each type
                        of room. In both cases, you will have to deal with the slithering Nightmares, which haunt the hallways
                        of the labyrinth.<br /><br />Onirim is a solo/cooperative card game. You (and a partner, if you wish)
                        must work (together) against the game to gather the eight Door cards before the deck runs out; you can
                        obtain those Door cards either by playing cards of the same color three turns in a row, or by discarding
                        (under specific circumstances) one of your powerful Key cards. In both cases you will have to decide the
                        best use of each card in your hand and carefully play around the Nightmares. Those cards are hidden in
                        the deck and will trigger painful dilemmas when drawn...<br /><br />Seven mini-expansions, all
                        standalone and compatible with one another, are included with the second edition of Onirim, including
                        these three that were in the first edition of the game:<br /><br /><br /> &amp;quot;The Towers&amp;quot;
                        introduces a new type of card that allows more searching and deck manipulation, while also imposing an
                        additional victory condition.<br /><br /><br /><br /> &amp;quot;Happy Dreams and Dark
                        Premonitions&amp;quot; adds evil time bombs that will impede your progress at predictable moments of
                        your quest as well as helpful but unreliable allies.<br /><br /><br /><br /> In &amp;quot;The Book of
                        Steps Lost and Found&amp;quot;, you must find the eight Door cards in a randomly given order and may
                        remove discarded cards from the game to cast powerful spells that will help you complete this difficult
                        task.<br /><br /><br />In addition to these three variants from the first edition, there are four new
                        modules in the Onirim 2nd edition box. Just like previously, each module consists of something that
                        makes the game easier and something that makes the game harder:<br /><br /><br /> &amp;quot;The
                        Glyphs&amp;quot; introduces a fourth symbol on location cards (apart from Key, Sun and Moon), which
                        makes it easier to compose the row of unrepeated symbols. Player must then find one extra door of each
                        color (so 12 doors in total) to win<br /><br /><br /><br /> &amp;quot;The Dreamcatchers&amp;quot; are
                        four cards that &amp;quot;guard&amp;quot; the Limbo piles. The Limbo pile stays with Dreamcatcher until
                        some effect allows the player to shuffle the pile back to the deck... if all Dreamcatchers are full and
                        new cards should come to Limbo, a Dreamcatcher is discarded and his cards shuffled back. Also, four new
                        &amp;quot;Lost Dreams&amp;quot; cards are supposed to be in Limbo at the end of the game, as an extra
                        winning condition - so discarding all Dreamcatchers means loss.<br /><br /><br /><br /> &amp;quot;The
                        Crossroads and Dead Ends&amp;quot; introduce location cards with a given symbol (3 Sun, 2 Moon, 1 Key),
                        but serving as any color &amp;quot;joker&amp;quot;. It also contains 10 &amp;quot;Dead End&amp;quot;
                        cards, that remain in players hand (un-discard-able on its own) and block her 5-cards hand limit...
                        until a player discards the whole hand (=the only way to discard a Dead End).<br /><br /><br /><br />
                        &amp;quot;The Door To The Oniverse&amp;quot; brings several one-time abilities cards as
                        &amp;quot;inhabitants of the Oniverse&amp;quot;... and one extra colorless door to
                        find.<br /><br /><br />Apart from all those, there are a few special rules to use the dark meeple in the
                        game (which interferes with Nightmare cards resolving), making the game easier or harder, depending on
                        the chosen variant.<br /><br />

                        let one of your wagon mates succumb to a calamity rather than expend precious supplies. And every time
                        players go the way of all flesh, you&amp;rsquo;ll flip over the roster card and write their names on
                        tombstones (don&amp;rsquo;t forget to include a quick epitaph). It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to relive
                        your fond memories of one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most beloved computer games, and to kill off your
                        family and friends at the same time.<br /><br />

                        <strong>Description:</strong> <br />
                        Pandemic: The Cure, a dice-based version of the popular Pandemic board game, sets up in less than a
                        minute and plays in 30 minutes. As in the board game, four diseases threaten the world and it's up to
                        your team to save humanity. You and your team must keep the world's hotspots in check before they break
                        out of control, while researching cures to the four plagues.<br /><br />Players roll dice each turn to
                        determine the actions available to them. They can fly and sail between the six major population centers
                        of the world, treat disease in their current region, collect samples for further study, and exchange
                        knowledge to help them in their goal of discovering cures. Each player takes on a different role that
                        has its own unique set of dice and abilities &amp;mdash; and players must take advantage of their
                        specializations if they are to have any hope of winning the game. The Dispatcher, for example, can spend
                        dice to fly others around the board, while the Medic is particularly adept at treating disease. Players
                        can roll their dice as often as they like, but the more times they re-roll for the perfect turn, the
                        more likely the next epidemic will occur.<br /><br />At the end of each turn, new &amp;quot;infection
                        dice&amp;quot; are rolled to determine the type and location of newly infected populations. If any
                        region on the board is infected with more than three dice of a given color, an outbreak occurs,
                        spreading disease into an adjacent region. If too many outbreaks take place, too many people get
                        infected, or the rate of infection gets too high, all the players lose. If, however, the players can
                        discover the cures to the four diseases, they all win and humanity is saved!<br /><br />Part of the
                        Pandemic series.<br /><br />

                        In Patchwork, two players compete to build the most aesthetic (and high-scoring) patchwork quilt on a
                        personal 9x9 game board. To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a
                        marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons &amp;mdash; the
                        currency/points in the game &amp;mdash; and someone is chosen as the start player.<br /><br />On a turn,
                        a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To
                        purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's
                        location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track
                        a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your
                        board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as
                        possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another
                        turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do
                        this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take
                        one button from the bank for each space you moved.<br /><br />In addition to a button cost and time
                        cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time
                        track, you earn &amp;quot;button income&amp;quot;: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal
                        game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.<br /><br />What's more, the time track depicts
                        five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever
                        first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game
                        board.<br /><br />Additionally, the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board
                        earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game. (Of course, this doesn't happen in every
                        game.)<br /><br />When a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the
                        time track, he takes one final button income from the bank. Once both players are in the center, the
                        game ends and scoring takes place. Each player scores one point per button in his possession, then loses
                        two points for each empty square on his game board. Scores can be negative. The player with the most
                        points wins.<br /><br />

                        Patchwork Express features the same basic gameplay as Patchwork, but with a smaller playing area and
                        with larger and less complex pieces.<br /><br />In the game, each player tries to build the most
                        aesthetic (and high-scoring) patchwork quilt on a personal 7x7 game board. To start play, lay out all of
                        the light-colored patches at random in a circle and place a starting marker in a particular location.
                        Each player takes some buttons &amp;mdash; the currency/points in the game &amp;mdash; and someone is
                        chosen as the start player.<br /><br />On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches
                        standing clockwise of the starting marker or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons
                        shown on the patch, move the starting marker to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to
                        your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time
                        shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other
                        patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is
                        behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent
                        now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to
                        the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each
                        space you moved.<br /><br />In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3
                        buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn &amp;quot;button
                        income&amp;quot;: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many
                        buttons from the bank.<br /><br />What's more, the time track depicts six 1x1 patches on it, and during
                        set-up you place six actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track
                        claims this patch and immediately places it on their game board.<br /><br />At some point during the
                        game, dark-colored patches are added to what's available for players to take, and these pieces are
                        smaller than the light-colored ones, making it more likely that they'll fill in holes on a player's
                        board.<br /><br />

                        <strong>Description:</strong> <br />
                        In Puerto Rico players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of
                        the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing
                        buildings.<br /><br />Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings,
                        plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of
                        resources and doubloons.<br /><br />The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they
                        exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to
                        produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are
                        manned by colonists.<br /><br />During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those
                        on the table (such as &amp;quot;Trader&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Builder&amp;quot;). When a role is chosen,
                        every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also
                        receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &amp;quot;Builder&amp;quot; role
                        allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on
                        that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses
                        that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all
                        the roles throughout a typical course of a game.<br /><br />Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order
                        mechanic, where a &amp;quot;governor&amp;quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the
                        conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first
                        action.<br /><br />Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned
                        &amp;quot;large buildings.&amp;quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and
                        come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact
                        score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of
                        each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of
                        shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role
                        that can end the game.<br /><br />In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include
                        both Puerto Rico: Expansion I &amp;ndash; New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II &amp;ndash; The
                        Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico (with two expansions), not this
                        regular game entry for Puerto Rico.<br /><br />

                        work together, share what they found, and craft supplies. If you prepare well enough, you may survive
                        the Night.<br /><br />Be prepared for more than just bumps in the night. Weather, animals, and other
                        wild things will put you and your team to the test. BEWARE: Fall below two hearts and you will go
                        mad.<br /><br />Lose all of your hearts to risk or the elements, and you lose the game. Survive all of

                        Rolling America, based on the 2014 release Rolling Japan, is a light &amp;quot;multiplayer
                        solitaire&amp;quot; dice game. Each player has a map of the United States that's divided into fifty
                        (abstractly represented) states, which are then bunched together into six differently colored
                        areas.<br /><br />On a turn, a player draws two regular six-sided dice from a bag and rolls them; the
                        bag starts with seven dice, six matching the colors of the areas on the map along with a wild clear die.
                        All players now write down each number rolled on any state of the matching color, i.e., if the blue die
                        shows 4 and the yellow a 2, write a 4 in one blue state and a 2 in one yellow state. If the clear die is
                        rolled, you can place this number in a state of your choice; additionally, three times per game you can
                        choose to use a non-clear die as any color. However, neighboring states can't have numbers with a
                        difference larger than 1; if you can't place a number without breaking this rule, then you must place an
                        X in a state of the appropriate color. (If all the states in an area are filled, you can ignore the die
                        or use one of your three color changes to place the number elsewhere.)<br /><br />Rolling America has a
                        few changes from Rolling Japan. The &amp;quot;guard&amp;quot; action allows you to ignore the
                        neighboring number restriction three times during the game, and the &amp;quot;dupe&amp;quot; action
                        allows you to use one of the active dice twice in the same region. As in real life, Alaska and Hawaii
                        are not connected to the continental United States, so you can drop any numbers you want in those
                        states!<br /><br />After six dice have been rolled, mark one round as being complete, then return the
                        dice to the bag and start the next round. After eight rounds the game ends, and whoever has the fewest
                        Xs on their map wins.<br /><br />

                        two dice. He or she then knocks down the levers as follows:<br /><br />One number which is the combined

                        each dice.<br /><br />For example:<br /><br />If a one and a five are rolled, the player may choose to
                        knock down the lever covering the number six, or the levers covering numbers one AND five, or ANY other
                        combination of numbers adding up to six.<br /><br />The player continues to roll, knocking down levers
                        each turn, until he or she cannot use the whole of the dice count because those numbers in the box have
                        already been covered. (Note: If the 7,8 &amp;amp; 9 are covered, some versions let you choose to roll
                        one or two dice. Some use that rule if the total of the remaining numbers is less than
                        six.)<br /><br />The player's score is the total value of the numbers left uncovered (in some versions
                        the score is instead read directly from the numbers left on the box -- if the 2, 4, &amp;amp; 6 are
                        left, then your score is 246). All the levers are then raised again, and play passes to the next
                        player.<br /><br />There are several methods of scoring. In the traditional pub gambling game, you add
                        up all the levers left uncovered. The games pays out after one round (one turn per player who paid into
                        the pool). If you manage to &amp;quot;shut the box&amp;quot; you win instantly and get double the stake
                        from each player.<br /><br />In other scoring methods, you play multiple rounds, with players adding
                        points to their previous score. As players reach forty-five (or other set number) they go 'bust' and
                        must drop out of the game. The game then ends when only one player remains in the game. He or she is the
                        winner.<br /><br />If any player knocks down ALL the levers in his or her turn, and thus 'shuts the
                        box', they are automatically declared the winner!<br /><br />This was later the inspiration for the NBC
                        Daytime TV game show High Rollers airing from 1974 until 1975 and again from 1979 until 1980 under the
                        name as (The New) High Rollers and much later in Syndication from 1975 until 1976 and from 1987 until
                        1988.<br /><br />

                        Edited description from Bruno Faidutti's write-up of the game in his Ideal Game
                        Library:<br /><br />Skull &amp;amp; Roses is the quintessence of bluffing, a game in which everything is
                        played in the players' heads. Each player plays a face-down card, then each player in turn adds one more
                        card &amp;ndash; until someone feels safe enough to state that he can turn a number of cards face up and
                        get only roses. Other players can then overbid him, saying they can turn even more cards face up. The
                        highest bidder must then turn that number of cards face up, starting with his own. If he shows only
                        roses, he wins; if he reveals a skull, he loses, placing one of his cards out of play. Two successful
                        challenges wins the game. Skull &amp;amp; Roses is not a game of luck; it's a game of poker face and
                        meeting eyes.<br /><br />Skull &amp;amp; Roses Red features the same gameplay as Skull &amp;amp; Roses,
                        with the only change being alternate rules that allow each player to control two biker gangs. Both Skull
                        &amp;amp; Roses Red and Skull are playable on their own, with each game containing six different biker
                        gangs. Each Skull or Skull &amp;amp; Roses set can be combined with another to allow for games with more
                        than six players.<br /><br />

                        forest. Each bird is a different colour in the game.<br /><br />Players are forest spirits, trying to
                        secretly guide their chosen bird to success. The cards are numbered 1 to 7 in red, blue, green and
                        white. The players lay a card from their hand to a 5x5 grid after nut tokens (points) are laid out for
                        each row and column.<br /><br />When the grid is full of cards, the rows and columns are checked. The
                        colour with the highest total in a line takes the nut token for that bird. Colours with tied totals are
                        ignored, so a low value card can win the nut token for that bird.<br /><br />When the nuts are totalled
                        up for the birds, the players reveal their final hand card. That card is the bird they favoured (so more
                        than one player might be helping the same bird), and for each player, the number on the card is added to
                        the nut total to identify who has the dominant bird.<br /><br />Since the players choose which bird they
                        favour by leaving it as their final hand card, they can delay this choice until they see how the game is
                        panning out.<br /><br />The game rules come in Japanese and English, the game itself being language
                        free. The game includes rules for 2-4 players or a solitaire/co-op mode for 1-2

                        malfunctioning spaceship.<br /><br />Your goal is to ensure that all ship systems are functioning
                        properly before time runs out. Each player must deal with the various malfunctions in their sector by
                        flipping cards from the malfunction deck in front of them, and fixing the ship's systems. You'll have an
                        arsenal of disorganized space tools spread among all players' hands, but finding the right tools can be
                        harder than you think, especially when your Spaceteam is franticly worrying about malfunctions in their
                        own sector. If that wasn&amp;rsquo;t hard enough, you&amp;rsquo;ll also have to deal with complications
                        such as wormholes and asteroid fields, which require the coordination of the entire Spaceteam. There are
                        no turns; everyone plays and shouts at the same time. Victory is achieved if enough malfunctions are
                        corrected to reveal the 6 hidden System-Go Cards before time is up.<br /><br />

                        In the most distant reaches of the world, magic still exists, embodied by spirits of the land, of the
                        sky, and of every natural thing. As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further
                        and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they
                        do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.<br /><br />Spirit Island is
                        a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders.
                        Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn,
                        players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using
                        combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects.
                        Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are
                        slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy,
                        and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread
                        presence into new areas of the island.<br /><br />The Invaders expand across the island map in a
                        semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next
                        turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there,
                        bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present.<br /><br />The islanders fight
                        back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so
                        exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders
                        or clean the land of blight.<br /><br />The game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their
                        presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up
                        their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history.<br /><br />At game
                        start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the
                        Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or
                        cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the
                        Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.<br /><br />The game includes different adversaries to
                        fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different
                        ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain
                        skill.<br /><br />

                        points by collecting sets of colorful stones from a central bowl and giving them to the five animals on
                        your score board.<br /><br />On your turn, you use action cards to draw or add stones to the bowl, use
                        powerful spirit abilities, or send Coyote to distract your opponent. Always the trickster, Coyote
                        prevents your opponent from giving stones to an animal of your choice, which might be just what you need
                        to take the lead.<br /><br />The game ends when five spirit stones are released from the bag. Add up the
                        points you gained for each animal, and the player with the most points wins!<br /><br />

                        Spot it!, a.k.a. Dobble, is a simple pattern recognition game in which players try to find an image
                        shown on two cards.<br /><br />Each card in original Spot it! features eight different symbols, with the
                        symbols varying in size from one card to the next. Any two cards have exactly one symbol in common. For
                        the basic Spot it! game, reveal one card, then another. Whoever spots the symbol in common on both cards
                        claims the first card, then another card is revealed for players to search, and so on. Whoever has
                        collected the most cards when the 55-card deck runs out wins!<br /><br />Rules for different games
                        &amp;ndash; each an observation game with a speed element &amp;ndash; are included with Spot it!, with
                        the first player to find a match either gaining or getting rid of a card. Multiple versions of Spot it!
                        have been published, with images in each version ranging from Halloween to hockey to baseball to San
                        Francisco.<br /><br />The game is sold as Spot it! in the USA and Dobble in Europe, with slight
                        differences between the two editions.<br /><br />Note: some versions have fewer cards and fewer symbols
                        per card. (E.g. 30 cards with 6 symbols each.): Spot it! 1,2,3<br /><br />

                        In 2010, designer Klaus Teuber overhauled the two-player Catan card game with the release of The Rivals
                        for Catan &amp;ndash; released in Germany as Die F&amp;uuml;rsten von Catan &amp;ndash; and in 2011
                        Teuber, Kosmos and Mayfair Games present a new multi-player card game set in the Catan universe: The
                        Struggle for Catan, aka, Die Siedler von Catan: Das schnelle Kartenspiel.<br /><br />As in the original
                        The Settlers of Catan board game, players need to manage their resources in order to build settlements,
                        roads, cities, city improvements and knights, all of which grant victory points (VPs) or special
                        abilities. Control of roads and knights can change hands during the game, so don't assume that what's
                        yours will stay yours. City improvements are expensive, but they bring you additional VPs and other
                        bonuses, so strive to spiff up your cities! The first player to have ten VPs wins the
                        game.<br /><br />The game is dice-less and resource gain and exchanging is based on each player's
                        developments making this version less luck dependent than the original. A twist in the game is that
                        certain developments are limited and can be stolen from other players once there are no new ones left.
                        The first player to gain 10 victory points, wins the game.<br /><br />(Note that Kosmos lists this game
                        with a 30-minute playing time, while Mayfair Games sets the playing time at 45-60
                        minutes.)<br /><br />Mixing two copies of game, can be played with 5 and 6 players.<br /><br />

                        In the super-fast sushi card game Sushi Go!, you are eating at a sushi restaurant and trying to grab the
                        best combination of sushi dishes as they whiz by. Score points for collecting the most sushi rolls or
                        making a full set of sashimi. Dip your favorite nigiri in wasabi to triple its value! And once you've
                        eaten it all, finish your meal with all the pudding you've got! But be careful which sushi you allow
                        your friends to take; it might be just what they need to beat you!<br /><br />Sushi Go! takes the
                        card-drafting mechanism of Fairy Tale and 7 Wonders and distills it into a twenty-minute game that
                        anyone can play. The dynamics of &amp;quot;draft and pass&amp;quot; are brought to the fore, while
                        keeping the rules to a minimum. As you see the first few hands of cards, you must quickly assess the
                        make-up of the round and decide which type of sushi you'll go for. Then, each turn you'll need to weigh
                        which cards to keep and which to pass on. The different scoring combinations allow for some clever plays
                        and nasty blocks. Round to round, you must also keep your eye on the goal of having the most pudding
                        cards at the end of the game!<br /><br />

                        Taboo is a party word game. Players take turns describing a word or phrase on a drawn card to their
                        partner without using five common additional words or phrases also on the card. The opposing partners
                        watch a timer and use a buzzer to stop the game, buzz the player describing if one of the five off
                        limits words or phrases is used, or the describing player makes any gestures. The describing team gets a
                        point for each card they guess successfully and the opposing team gets a point for each card they pass
                        on, make gestures on, or lose for saying one of the off limits words or phrases. An excellent party

                        <strong>Description:</strong> <br />
                        In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World
                        Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean
                        coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations
                        and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded
                        not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure
                        throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.<br /><br />The players acquire unique
                        project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards)
                        can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface,
                        building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up
                        the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of
                        different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature,
                        oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying
                        cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41
                        megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your
                        cards.<br /><br />Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating
                        (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your
                        income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other
                        sources.<br /><br />Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards,
                        and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the
                        game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You
                        also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation
                        (guess why) and consists of the following phases:<br /><br />1) Player order shifts clockwise.<br />2)
                        Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.<br />3) Action phase: Players take
                        turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award,
                        using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat
                        into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table
                        (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.<br />4) Production phase: Players get resources
                        according to their terraform rating and production parameters.<br /><br />When the three global
                        parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and
                        the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other VPs to determine the winning
                        corporation!<br /><br />

                        players ante gold to the stakes and compete to play the strongest flight of three cards, dragons, or
                        mortals. The strongest flight wins that gold from the stakes, but playing weaker cards triggers your
                        cards' powers and sets you up to win the next hand. This Legendary Edition includes new Legendary
                        Dragons, Mortals, Gold and Platinum Pieces, and Ability Disks for combining Three-Dragon Ante with the
                        Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons tabletop game!<br /><br />The craftiest (and luckiest) player wins by taking
                        the most gold!<br /><br />&amp;mdash;description from the publisher<br /><br />

                        <strong>Description:</strong> <br />
                        The year is 1667 and you are a pirate sailing the waters of the Caribbean. A Spanish Galleon floats
                        nearby, and you&amp;rsquo;ve talked your crewmates into working together to steal all of its treasure.
                        What you haven&amp;rsquo;t told your fellow pirates is that you have no intentions on sharing the
                        treasure once you have it. Your crewmates have told you that they share your loyalty and that
                        they&amp;rsquo;ll help you maroon the greedy pirates on your ship to the rocky island of Tortuga. But
                        you&amp;rsquo;ve seen your friends&amp;rsquo; loaded pistols and heard their whisperings of a mutiny.
                        You know that nobody can be trusted.<br /><br />Tortuga is all about the interactions you have with the
                        other players. In some cases, such as when you and your shipmates are attacking the Spanish Galleon, you
                        need to rely on your enemies in order to succeed. In the very next turn, however, your shipmates might
                        stab you in the back with a mutiny in order to keep all the treasure for themselves.<br /><br />Since
                        nobody holds a &amp;quot;hand&amp;quot; of cards, this game is also about knowledge and communication
                        regarding the community Event cards. Unless you are in desperation mode, it is not wise to reveal Event
                        cards at random. Almost half of the Event cards can hurt your team drastically. It's often in your best
                        interest to use an action to view the cards first, or to rely on the knowledge of a trusted ally.
                        Knowing where harmful Event cards are located allows you to force an enemy to reveal those cards and
                        suffer the consequences. The most successful players are the ones who are able to discern who is on
                        their team and then share vital information with them at opportune moments.<br /><br />Vote cards also
                        play a key role in the game. Each Vote card has three sections - one each for Attacks, Mutinies, and
                        Brawls. Players must put themselves in the best position to use their Vote cards, since their hand of
                        Vote cards may not always be ideal based on their pawn location. For example, sometimes it may be worth
                        putting in Water, causing an attack to fail, in order to save a Crossbones card for when you want to
                        Mutiny against your captain.<br /><br />For 2-9 Players. 20-40 minutes. Ages 12+.<br /><br />Volume 2 in

                        In Trash Pandas, players are raucous raccoons, tipping over trash cans for food (and shiny objects).
                        Players push their luck to acquire more cards, but must stash them in order for them to count as points
                        at the end of the game. When the deck runs out, the game ends and players compare their stashes to see
                        who has the majority for each card type and score points accordingly. The player with the most points
                        wins!<br /><br />In more detail, on a turn the active player rolls a die in the hope of gaining the
                        benefit of the roll result. With each roll, the player decides to keep rolling or stop and activate the
                        dice results. However, with each additional roll, the odds of busting (getting a duplicate result)
                        increase further and the player risks losing the progress they've made that round. When activating the
                        dice results, the player will draw cards, steal cards from other players, and stash cards. Cards in hand
                        may be used for their listed ability, but they count as points only when
                        stashed.<br /><br />&amp;mdash;description from the publisher<br /><br />

                        <strong>Description:</strong> <br />
                        From the publisher:<br /><br />A beautiful and beautifully simple game of laying a tile before your own
                        token to continue its path on each turn. The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone
                        else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and
                        another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go. Easy to
                        introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to
                        8.<br /><br />Theme:<br /><br />Tsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the
                        &amp;quot;many roads that lead to divine wisdom&amp;quot;, and the game as a whole representing
                        &amp;quot;the classic quest for enlightenment&amp;quot;.<br /><br />This theme is very light and the
                        game essentially plays as an abstract.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /><br />The game consists of tiles with
                        twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player
                        has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to
                        your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is
                        stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another
                        player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you
                        are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board.
                        Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board
                        whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the
                        same.<br /><br />Other notes:<br /><br />Tsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the
                        name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time. Somewhat similar to Metro and
                        Spaghetti Junction.<br /><br />

                        points. In turns, players attempt to play a card by matching its color, number, or word to the topmost
                        card on the discard pile. If unable to play, players draw a card from the draw pile, and if still unable
                        to play, they pass their turn. Wild and special cards spice things up a bit.<br /><br />UNO is a

                        Raiders, Merchants. Farmers produce turnips, Walls block Raiders, Raiders steal turnips, and Merchants
                        either add new cards to your hand or help you purchase a relic. All cards return to hand, and the next
                        round begins! The game ends as soon as any one player has three royal relics.<br /><br />

                        Welcome to the Dungeon &amp;mdash; first released as Dungeon of Mandom &amp;mdash; is a push-your-luck
                        dungeon delve in which 2-4 players take turns essentially daring each other to go into a dungeon with
                        less equipment than they start off with while filling the dungeon with monsters. Players can win the
                        game by winning 2 rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing 2 rounds. Each player has a 2-sided
                        players card that has a white side and a red side. The first win taps the player card and the 1st loss
                        flips the card over to the red side. A 2nd loss will have the player turn the card back into the
                        box.<br /><br />The game is played in rounds. The player sets up the base character and all the
                        equipment equipped. This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.<br /><br />Each
                        round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a
                        dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn.<br /><br />If they choose
                        to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and de-equip an equipment or (2) place it face down
                        in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with
                        monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot
                        participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have
                        passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the
                        equipment he has equipped.<br /><br />The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the
                        monsters within. Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by
                        increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round. If not,
                        they lose. The players then reshuffles all the cards to make a new monster deck and re-equips all the

                        <strong>Description:</strong> <br />
                        Yahtzee is a classic dice game played with 5 dice. Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice up to
                        3 times in hope of making 1 of 13 categories. Examples of categories are 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind,
                        straight, full house, etc. Each player tries to fill in a score for each category, but this is not
                        always possible. When all players have entered a score or a zero for all 13 categories, the game ends
                        and total scores are compared.<br /><br />The traditional (public domain) game Yacht predates the
                        trademarked game, and has slightly different scoring.<br /><br />There are four basic scoring difference
                        between the tradition game Yacht and Yahtzee. They are: 1) Yacht has no Three of a Kind category, 2)
                        there are no bonuses in Yacht, 3) there are no Joker rules in Yacht, and 4) the Full House category is
                        scored as the sum of the dice. The other scoring rules are identical between the two
                        games.<br /><br />Travel versions of the game use a device that keeps the dice captured within
                        compartments of a plastic box and allows players to &amp;quot;lock&amp;quot; a particular die between
                        rolls.<br /><br />
